Intentionally retro game both in appearance and in coding style. Intended for modification and education for beginner Python programmers by using simple syntax and patterns. Modify to your preferences!

The basic functions for rotation, movement, and collision detection are in there. You could make any number of new games based on these common game functions. Indeed, this game was based on the code from the tankgame game in a sibling repo. 

2 players battle it out 70's style commanding a space ship that can rotate, apply thrust, and fire torpedoes. Ships have a force field that protects from torpedoes and the spinning rocks that crisscross the screen. Hide in the nebulaes for cover. Watch your health bar!

Developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04
